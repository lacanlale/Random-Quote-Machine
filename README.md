# Random-Quote-Machine
This project is for the FreeCodeCamp Course. 
It is to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate random quotes from a website.

This pen utilizes a set of 10 quotes, all of which are locally defined in the Javascript code.
The quotes are created in an array and are accessed randomly, staying true to the "random" aspect of the quote machine.

Included is a redirect link to share on Twitter or Tumblr, as well as a link to view my blog.
